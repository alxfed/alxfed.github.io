### Ontology is a good enough word, don't spoil it. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the time of Aristotle the word 'Ontology' meant
a very particular thing. He argued that if the Artist 'sees' a shape of a
statue in a piece of wood, it means that this shape and the statue itself
'exists' before it has been carved. On and on he goes to the point where he
declares that this 'shape' is a substance that exists perpetually without
change. And, of course, *__Ontology__* will be the science dealing with the
"ultimate grounds of being". More about it in a very popular form in (1).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Aristotle _form_ was an ultimate reality
and _matter_ was just a 'potential' reality... drumbeat... because _matter_ can 
take many different _forms_. So, the _idea_ is real, _matter_ is secondary.<br>
