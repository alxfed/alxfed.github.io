title:  "The Genesis of Authors and Ideas."
excerpt: "There is a real genesis of ideas and their authors, it exists. It is well hidden, that is true, but finally you can figure it out yourself (for yourself) in this age of instantly accessible information."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began reading books in 2014 pretty much without any system, over time I started sensing this foundation of ideas underlying the contemporary system of knowledge and the true authors of these ideas in their contemporary form. Sometimes the discoveries were stunning, sometimes they were pretty obvious (when you know what happened) but very rarely they coinsided with the 'story' known from the socially accepted version of History.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I decided to create this Genesis for myself. It reflects my process of reading too, so, I will keep adding nodes to this graph until I get bored by the idea. I view it as a FÃ¼rstenzug of sorts, that I saw in Dresden once.<br>
