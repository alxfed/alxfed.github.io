### "You will have to change your profession 5 times..." 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once upon a time when I was a teenager somebody said something
about the 'future of jobs' in a context of such rapid progress around us... 
and I realized that probably I will have to change profession over the course of my life...
maybe even several times... My wife says that in her high school class a teacher even said
to them: "Kids, you will have to change your profession 5 times in your lifetime." - or 
something to that effect. Little did we know...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time was going on I became: a Physicist, a Programmer, a Data Scientist, 
a Small Business Owner, a Futures Broker, a Financier, a co-founder of the first... (maybe not, but 
we didn't know that the other ones existed in 1998) 'e-money' system, 
an online Derivatives Exchange CEO _and_ architect, an American Software Company owner/CEO, 
a 'start-up founder', a Data Scientist again...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the 2023 came with the explosion of language models, that reshuffled
all the "high-tech world" and its' hierarchies... Time to move on! Decision made! But 'moving on'
requires a miniscule detail... the name of my future profession/occupation. It's hard to expect 
this name to be invented by the 'founding fathers' of Large Language Models and 'AI startups', 
most of them (besides a handful) do not possess the necessary level of mental development to 
invent a term of this degree of generality, the "handful" is busy with working really hard on what they want. 
The working name for this profession that the daring programmers have assigned to themselves was 
'prompt engineer', which I consider to be technical, demeaning and very offensive 'name' for a person 
who possesses the ability to come up with the methodologically, philosiphically and linguistically 'right' 
questions and elucidate the vague and contradictory responses of the 'AI' for human consumers of its' 
all-enveloping 'wisdom' based on misappropriated knowledge of the humankind. So, as it turns
out, not only you have to change profession several times, but (!!!):
### You have to invent the name of your next profession! 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! It looks like going forward you will have to invent a name for your 
new profession every time. Well... I though about it myself, I considered the multiple options offered 
by ChatGPT, Bard, Claude (all in vain by the way), I finally came up with my own version, which 
my wife approved. The name of my next profession will be:<br>
<h1 align="center">AI Dialogue Facilitator</h1>
<br>I will explain why to those of you who don't understand... a little bit later.
