### "Who is an AI Dialogue Facilitator?" 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like the job description that I created several months ago most. It explains the process well and makes the idea of this job clear.<br>
<pre>
    As an AI Dialogue Facilitator I engage with AI on behalf of a client. 
    I select the most suitable models, methods of interaction, and implement 
    necessary software tools. Subsequently, together with the customer 
    I lead the dialogue, interpret and communicate interim outcomes, and 
    iterate the process as needed to attain a concrete outcome.
</pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how it happens. Also, it is important to explain to the client from the very beginning, that AI Dialog Facilitator reports directly to the CEO, President, or Chairman of the board. They need to know the results first.
