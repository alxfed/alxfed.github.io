### "Who is an AI Dialogue Facilitator?" 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like the job description that I created several months ago most. It explains the process well and makes the idea of this job clear.<br>
<pre>
    As an AI Dialogue Facilitator I engage with AI on behalf of a client. 
    I select the most suitable models, methods of interaction, and implement 
    necessary software tools. Subsequently, together with the customer 
    I lead the dialogue, interpret and communicate interim outcomes, and 
    iterate the process as needed to attain a concrete outcome.

    AI Dialog Facilitator performs the following tasks:
    * Formulates tasks for the AI model(s) used by the company, ensuring a 
      reasonable expectation of success.
    * Collects and organizes materials and data to provide descriptive context 
      to and documented precedents for interactions with the companyâ€™s AI.
    * Recommends the appropriate form of interaction with AI for each task, 
      such as one-on-one dialogue, group conversation with AI, or multilateral 
      conversation involving multiple copies of AI with adversarial instructions
      and one or more humans.
    * Sets up and moderates the course of all these types of interactions, 
      documenting the stages of conversations, AI responses, and momentary 
      decisions made by the human participants.

> **Claude:** Here is a concise suggestion for demonstrating your AI Dialogue Facilitator skills to potential employers or clients:<br>Prepare a portfolio highlighting your experience facilitating human-AI interactions. Include concrete examples such as dialogue transcripts, data preparation documents, recommendations on interaction formats, and summaries of outcomes. Offer to perform a demonstration by engaging company representatives and AI models in a sample consultation or ideation session tailored to their needs. Focus on listening to objectives, clarifying expectations, recommending approaches, mediating the discussion, and presenting takeaways. Emphasize adaptability and commitment to iterative refinement of techniques for optimal results.

I think I will prepare the [portfolio](https://github.com/ai-dialogue-facilitator) that Claude suggested first.
