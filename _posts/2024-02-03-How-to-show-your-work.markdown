### "Who is an AI Dialogue Facilitator?" 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like the job description that I created several months ago most. It explains the process well and makes the idea of this job clear.<br>
<pre>
    As an AI Dialogue Facilitator I engage with AI on behalf of a client. 
    I select the most suitable models, methods of interaction, and implement 
    necessary software tools. Subsequently, together with the customer 
    I lead the dialogue, interpret and communicate interim outcomes, and 
    iterate the process as needed to attain a concrete outcome.
</pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI Dialog Facilitator performs the following tasks:
* Formulates tasks for the AI model(s) used by the company, ensuring a reasonable expectation of success.
* Collects and organizes materials and data to provide descriptive context and documented precedents for interactions with the companyâ€™s AI.
* Recommends the appropriate form of interaction with AI for each task, such as one-on-one dialogue, group conversation with AI, or multilateral conversation involving multiple copies of AI with adversarial instructions and one or more humans.
* Sets up and moderates the course of all these types of interactions, documenting the stages of conversations, AI responses, and momentary decisions made by the human participants.
The AI Dialog Facilitator reports directly to the CEO, President, or Chairman of the board.

This is how it happens.
