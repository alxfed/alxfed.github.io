&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the very first book that ignited my interest to Physics back in 1969, it was a Russian translation of Eric M. Rogers' book "Physics for the Inquiring mind". I totally caught the virus of creative and critical thinking from _it_ then. By the way, I always felt that I belong to some kind of a different 'school' of physics and now, after reading about Eric Rogers I understand what it was (and is). After Trinity college he spent some time in Cavendish Lab, that's where this style of thinking that I caught up from him is about, Cavendindish Lab!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funnily enough the original book has a first page that was missing in the Russian translation, it is called: "Preliminary Problems Leading to Chapter I". What a shame that I wasn't able to read it then! Damn you, stupid two-faced bolshevik-pretending-to-be-physicist Arzimovich (the editor of the translation)! And sure enough the third item of the list of problems is:

"**3.** Look up the word "data." Then write short answers to the following:
1. What is its origin?
2. Which of the following statements do you consider correct language and which incorrect? (Where incorrect, mention reason.)
- These data were obtained by my partner.
- This data was obtained by my partner.
- This set of data was obtained by my partner."

Wow! I wish I saw it then, 50 years ago. But I didn't. So, let's do it now!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In google and wikipedia we immediately find the answer to the first question:
> mid 18th century: from Latin 'datum', literally ‘something given’, neuter past participle of dare ‘give’.

It is funny that the Russian word "данные" totally carries the same meaning and even the flavour of 'something given'.
