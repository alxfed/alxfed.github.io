There are several problems in the Natural Language Processing Universe that I would like to explore and, maybe, try to solve or at least contibute to their solution. Namely:
* The problem of synthesizing a language for automated systems that will use it in their communications with humans. It's a two-fold problem that consists of two connected parts: inventing a classification of meanings similar to Roget's and developing algorithms that will synthesize the controlled language based on these ideas and a contemporary 'corpus' of texts that will exist at the moment of such synthesis ([robo-english](https://github.com/robo-english));
* The overall problem of 'simplification' of English Language in a way that serves the purpose of communications in everyday life as well as in science and technology better than our present attempts of 'axiomatization' and creation of 'symbols' that took over Mathematics and Physics after the beginning of the XX-th century and have gone absolutely rampant in the age of 'internet marketing' and wrongly understood marketing and 'branding' ([simple-english](https://github.com/simple-english));
* My personal studies of 'BASIC-english' of C.K. Ogden ([basic-english](https://github.com/basic-english)), 'The Thesaurus of English words and __phrases__' by Roget and my attempts to modernize and update their ideas and achievements with the help of contemporary algorithmic and statistical toolset ([english-language](https://github.com/english-language));
* My personal studies of 'simple' versions of wikipedia and wiktionary, their achievements in use of synthetically simplified narrative ([simple-english](https://github.com/simple-english)). Maybe some of them can be used in the development of methodology and 'corpus' of texts for the robo-english described above;
* The materials that I found about the movement for 'Plain English' (an attempt to remove or minimize 'legalese' from everyday communications of humans) are in the [plain-english](https://github.com/plain-english) organization. These can be used for the **synthetic simplification** that I'm working on too.
<br>

The reason why I keep creating these virtual organizations (as if I'm an idiot) is: the GitHub tracking of changes on the repository level is not flexible enough for me; it had been designed with a different purpose in mind and one of the aspects of that purpose was 'control' over the 'creative force' and in particular the ability of a 'manager' to see (and roll back) complete deletions. That is not what I need for my research here, sorry.<br><br>
Another aspect are the so called 'licences' - the meaningless files added semi-automatically to repositories that protect mega-corporations from being sued when they copy/steal the results of the people who are _creating_ their programs and texts. I refuse to include these ritual shamanic trance dances with a tambourine into the body of my humble work. If it proves to be useful it will be stolen in an instant anyway (it happened to me in a big way at least 3 times over the course of my life), if not - nobody cares; why bother then? Of course the repositories that I fork from other organizations and individuals who are on GitHub will have the attribution and these 'licenses' (which, I repeat, have no legal significance for the author!) that _they_ set-up in the system.<br><br>
The other organizations are:
- [robo-language](https://github.com/robo-language);
- [in-robo-english](https://github.com/in-robo-english);
- [in-robo](https://github.com/in-robo);
- [in-basic-english](https://github.com/in-basic-english);
- [in-plain-english](https://github.com/in-plain-english);
- [in-simple-english](https://github.com/in-simple-english);
- [in-english](https://github.com/in-english); 
- [universal-english](https://github.com/universal-english));
- [common-english](https://github.com/common-english);
- [in-common-english](https://github.com/in-common-english);
<br>

The other thematic virtual organizations are:
- [natural-language](https://github.com/natural-language);
- [natural-language-understanding](https://github.com/natural-language-understanding);
- [natural-language-meaning](https://github.com/natural-language-meaning);
- [natural-language-generation](https://github.com/natural-language-generation);
- [natural-english](https://github.com/natural-english).

I only squat good names when I know that the bedrock gold is right here, 'Burning Daylight' taught me that, when I read a book about him as a little boy. But I'm not greedy, ping me if you'd like to come _with your own repository_ and participate, I will fork it at your request into one of these virtual organizations.

Talk to you later.
