title:  "Is 'algorithmecally complex' somewhat irreversible?"
excerpt: "Reversible and irreversible are asolute categories, how about making them quantitative? Is something that requires the energy of a supernova to recalculculate it back to initial state 'reversible'? Also, this 'meta' approach of judging about the reversibility of systems by the amount of energy necessary to 'revert' it seems to be the door to a better understanding of information/entropy, isn't it?"

### Programming and reversibility.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a 'dicussion' with a dude of facebook about the tautological nature of 
algorithmic programming and all of the sudden for myself I said: "The deep learning systems are so
complex that it takes a lot of energy to recalculate them back into their initial state". A peculiar
idea, isn't it?
