&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow, as always, nobody seems to ask the right question, namely: "What are we __*teaching*__ our machines when they are 'machine-learning'? What type of behavior we are encouraging or discouraging? How does it allign with our overall goals and particular (and momentary) expectations? Let's look into it in a little bit of a detail.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's watch the hands of the prestidigitator closely,
maybe we will be able to notice where the rabbit comes from if we watch it in
slow motion:
- Step 1:...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The completely forbidden practice was to look up the answer to a problem that you were given before you at least tried to solve it yourself. It went as far as removing the pages with answers to the problems from the books in the school library.
Remember when your teacher was saying to you:"Sit down,
you are just __guessing__ (the right answer)." Did your teacher of mathematics
or physics say that to you? Mine did! And I was really good at it too, somehow
I could imagine the space-time picture of pretty complex phenomena in motion
that I could (and still can) fast-forward or rewind and scale, rotate and shift
and see from any angle. I'm not as good at it as Ramanujan or something, but I
was pretty awesome compared to my classmates (and the teacher lady herself)
then,- I can only imagine how annoying it was for her. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, basically, what we should be doing is: to enourage
the meta-learning, the learning of the methods of aquisition of principles...
and the three "of" in a row symbolise just that the "meta" level of the task.<br>

I created a couple of virtual organizations for this topic... as always :)...
in https://github.com/machine-teaching and
https://github.com/teaching-machine-to-learn.<br><br>
Later.
