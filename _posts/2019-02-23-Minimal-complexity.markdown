&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't get it from some kinda' 'web-site', it's from Bartlett's Roget's Thesaurus! There you read it as:
>"Why philosophy is so complicated? It ought to be entirely simple."

But its not an exact quote! The exact quote is:
> "Why is philosophy so complicated? It ought, after all, to be _completely_ simple. 
Philosophy unties the knots in our thinking, which we have tangled up in
an absurd way; but to do that, it must make movements which are just as
complicated as the knots. Although the result of philosophy is simple, its
methods for arriving there cannot be so."<br><br>
Ludwig Wittgenstein

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it happens, the Internet version of the original is 'slightly simplified'... down to a level of impersonal chewing gum for lazy brains of disrespectful 'users' of course. But this may be a clue for our careful deliberations about language too. There is a minimal necessary level of complexity for our (and their) functioning in this roaring world of information. How about turning this into a guiding principle for our constructive proof?<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I can do it.

Later.
