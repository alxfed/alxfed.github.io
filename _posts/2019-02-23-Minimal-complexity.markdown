The meme goes like this:
"Why is philosophy so complicated? It ought, after all, to be completely
simple". 

The rest of the passage from p. 52 of his "Philosophical Remarks" goes like
this: 
"Philosophy unties the knots in our thinking, which we have tangled up in
an absurd way; but to do that, it must make movements which are just as
complicated as the knots. Although the result of philosophy is simple, its
methods for arriving there cannot be so."
                                            Ludwig Wittgenstein

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it happens, the Internet version is 'slightly simplified'... down to a level of impersonal chewing gum for lazy brains of disrespectful 'users' of course. But this may be a clue for our careful deliberations about language too. There is a minimal necessary level of complexity for their functioning in this roaring world of information.<br><br>
