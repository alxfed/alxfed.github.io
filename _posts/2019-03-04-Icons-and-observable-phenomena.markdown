&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time ago I bumped into a book that forced me to discover a whole new world view, contrary to the 'traditional' view still predominant in our contemporary science, especially among the 'theoretical physicists' and mathematicians. It has a confusing name 'realism', ha-ha-ha, and it doesn't mean what you think! What can be confusing about that, you ask? The confusion is in the answer to the question: 'what is real?' The so called 'realists' don't say that there is some kind of a 'nature' and there are some 'natural phenomena' out there that are _**real**_ as one might think. Nothing of the kind! They claim that the _**icons**_, which may be drawings, cryptic symbols (hi, Russell and Whitehead) or 'formulas' that they chose for representation of the observed phenomena are 'real', the conjectured definitions of their behaviour under changing conditions are 'real' in the sense that they map onto something that necessarily _can_ happen in reality. And, of course, the results of arithmetical and not so arithmetical (but always tautological) manipulations with these icons that will be done by the selected few who 'understand' the 'true meaning' (of these icons) is _**real**_. Really? Are they? What you wrote on your wrinkled piece of paper is _**guaranteed**_ to map onto something in the real world? You are saying that it is _**bound**_ to exist because you used summation and multiplication derived from counting distinctely different items? Yeah! Right! I can see what kind of a 'realist' you are, ha-ha-ha!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to my story about the book(s) I read. It's a relatively old book, from 1992, by a British professor Simon L. Altmann, called "Icons and Symmetries" (from it I discovered his other book "Rotations, Quaternions and Double groups" and the book by Elie Cartan "The Theory of Spinors"). He, by his book, made me realise once again, that the way we draw or otherwise  visually or symbolically 'represent' the observed phenomena influences our intuitions in a way that is not always productive and sometimes is outright wrong. His story was about Oersted, the cult of Hamilton, the 'Rodrigues construction' for consequitive rotations and on and on to spinors with a point that they are more fundamental than both types of vectors.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point that we should _never_ forget is that whatever we draw, whatever we say or write about the observable phenomena are just metaphors. They are created by our brain and are some vague 'approximation' of reality constructed by it. Sometimes these metaphors are 'spot on' (or at least we still think so today), sometimes they are useful in some situations but lead to errors and misunderstandings in other... as in this case with polar and axial vectors that he is discussing.<br><br> 
Later.
