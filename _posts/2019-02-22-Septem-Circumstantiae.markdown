&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turns out (finally, in 2010) the source of the "Five W's (and one H)" is nothing else that the Aristotle's "Nicomachean Ethics". There they are: quis, quid, quando, ubi, cur, quem ad modum, quibus adminiculis.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You understand that a robot is supposed to be able to explain the circumstances of events, don't you? Aristotle thinks that this is the way to do it (as it is explained by Michael C. Sloan):<br>
```
Regardless of the ambiguity of Aristotle’s Greek, ﬁve of the seven circum-
stances are easily identiﬁable, namely, the “who”, “what”, “by what means”,
“for the sake of what” or “why”,and “how”. The other two circumstances,
“where” and “when,” maybe found in the phrase (...).
