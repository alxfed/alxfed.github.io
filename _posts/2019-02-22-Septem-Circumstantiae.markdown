&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turns out (finally, in 2010) the source of the "Five W's (and one H)" is nothing else that the Aristotle's "Nicomachean Ethics". There they are: quis, quid, quando, ubi, cur, quem ad modum, quibus adminiculis.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You understand that a robot is supposed to be able to explain the circumstances of events, don't you? Aristotle thinks that this is the way to do it (as it is explained by Michael C. Sloan):<br>
<pre>
Regardless of the ambiguity of Aristotle’s Greek, ﬁve of the seven circum-
stances are easily identiﬁable, namely, the “who”, “what”, “by what means”,
“for the sake of what” or “why”,and “how”. The other two circumstances,
“where” and “when,” maybe found in the phrase (...).
</pre>

Notice the particular translations of individual circumstances.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that he is discussing a very interesting subject which totally maps onto the situation of Common-Language, namely: the person being interrogated in order to decide whether something has been done intentionally or just happened by itself, naturally, without any bad will involved. Basically, we are discussing putting a blame for what has happened upon somebody here.<br>
