title:  "Masking of individual words is just a counterfactual."
excerpt: "The enthusiastic youth is happy that it has found this wonderful 'new' idea of 'Transformer', 'BERT' and all that. Not so fast! It's just a good old counterfactual, people. But at the same time it can be a good reminder pointing into the right direction and here's why."

### Why we shouldn't be mentioning these catchy names.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a roaring crowd of aspiring data-satanists is about to
run over you shouting their new catchy word, be it 'BERT' or 'Transformer' or anything 
else for that matter, remember that "This too shall pass" and, please, don't react... 
not to say that if you join the crowd - you are lost, and maybe forever. As Feynman used
to say by the accounts of his collaborators: "Don't tell me what it is called, tell me
what it is/means."
### What do these 'new' tricks in machine processing of language _really_ mean?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's put our 'naked eye' aside and wear our microscope glasses.
What are these two things brought to our attention?
#### 1. The so called 'Transformer' is just a 'Transmission channel' of Shannon / Fano... or a simple chain of multiple encoders and decoders with one or more intermediate states.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a relatively simple idea, so many Ph.D. degrees have 
been sucked out of this finger that I'm not even talking about it. It is worth discussion
only in the context of choosing a 'common' language for human-machine interactions. The one
that would be equally meaningful for machines and humans and using it as a 'common denominator'
for mutual understanding.
#### 2. The so called bert 'BERT' is a probabilistic verification of multiple counterfactual hypothesis about a phrase.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. What exactly is this 'masking' of a word in a phrase? It is a
'counterfactual'! It is a counterfactual in a meta-language of course, but counterfactual
none the less.
