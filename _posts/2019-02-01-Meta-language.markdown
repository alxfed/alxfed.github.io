&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I disagree with the definition of the word 'metalanguage' given here: [Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalanguage) - as a language for __*description*__ of languages. I want to use this or other term for talking about the _meaning_ of what is being expressed by a language. In other words I want to discuss "why?" all these humans and machines use those particular words, phrases and sentences? What are their intentions and how these intentions can be represented in a meaningful way? How are these intentions translated into words? These are the questions similar to the Plato's understanding of 'meta' as something beyond the description of the phenomenon itself, the _meaning_ of it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of that I decided to use the hyphened form of the word 'meta-language' in my works that will be devoted to what I've just said - the combinations of meanings and intentions of the parties, communicating with the help of language.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding is much closer to what is described in this wikipedia article as [Compiler-compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler-compiler). And I agree with the constructive approach: defining a meta-language should result in creating a 'compiler' that can, in its turn, compile a 'parser'/'interpreter' and 'decompile' this 'compiler' back from the instance of the parser.<br><br>
Later.
