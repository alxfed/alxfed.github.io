title:  "Ideas, their meaning and their authors."
excerpt: "Once there is a machine that can retell and explain ideas in its own words the very foundation of 'copyright' as a right to copy ideas in the form of texts disappears and ideas become much more depersonalized. Meanings can not be 'copyrighted', but how do we go about with incentivizing the authors of ideas to keep creating them?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations! In case you didn't notice, we are living in an absolutely new World where reading a text authored by a human or hearing his/her speech is _not_ the only way to consume his or her ideas. We now have a 'retelling machine' that can explain the ideas that it 'knows' in its own words.

Later.
