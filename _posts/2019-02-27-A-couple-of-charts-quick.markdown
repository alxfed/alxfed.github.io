&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any doubt that there 'should be' a piece of software that would let you draw any and every type of a chart or graph? No, nobody doubts that. Can it be done? No. Nobody has any doubt in that either. Why? Why? Because charts and graphs... even if they are in a 'dry' scientific text... are supposed to attract attention, stand out, ignite curiousity. This means that the chart should be at least slightly 'non-standard', not done in a standard prescribed way on a known piece of software with its instantly recognizable 'features'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However...! If you are 'just working on it' and need to do it really quick(ly) these pieces of s...tware can be helpful. The diplodocus (Adobe) and the titanosaurus (Microsoft) came up with this:<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another and this time purely wonderful software for drawing that I found is called GeoGebra. I just started playing with it, created some 3D surfaces, their intersections, made them dynamic with sliders and movements etc. etc. I will definitely play with it more, it seems to be quite useful.<br><br>

Later.
