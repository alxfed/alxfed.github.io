&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found a couple of pictures not so long ago and they reminded me of my first date with a real computer which happened on this day, February 15 of 1977... or maybe on another day, but around that time, the end of winter in 1977.<br><br>
### It was a long time ago and it is not true.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time I was studying Physics in the Moscow State University and was looking around for an opportunity to make a good project for my diploma, graduate with it (which is an equivalent of MS) and if I'm lucky find a job. Somebody... I know who that was but I stroke out his name from my memory and am not going to mension him here... brought me to the Plasma Physics Lab, because they needed a 'student who can solder' for an accelerator group that was working on something very important (ha-ha!). And that was me of course, because my then friend knew that I assemble my own 'effects' for the guitar performances that I was into then. In any case that was an interesting excursion into the world of _Real Physics_ which proved to be amazingly not true much later, hehe.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time the Soviet Union was under all sorts of technological embargoes for its 'good' behavior in the Third World countries and we are not even talking about its own people. It manufactured a complete copy of IBM 360 line somewhere in the Eastern European countries and a more compact (wardrobe sized) computer "Мир" which means "Peace" in Russian - the name that would tell you that it's, as always in the Bolshevik 'newspeak', something made for a purely military purpose. The Physics devision of the Moscow State University had a couple of those, they were breaking all the time and you had to get a time slot to run your program which students were not allowed to do unless they were doing it as a part of the course in programming (which was so idiotic that I didn't understand _anything_ from it, probably I was too stupid to understand what the idiot who 'taught' it was saying).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there it was. The thing. The 'computer'! It was in a CAMAC stand but approximately on the same level as in this picture. The "TPAi" (more about what it was - below), here it is:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said, the Soviet Union was under all sorts of sanctions and embargoes, but the 'socialist countries' of Eastern Europe - were not. Hungary in particular was enjoying a treatment almost as any other country and could buy all sorts of electronic components from the States. Their main Physics institute KFKi purchased a couple boatloads of components and put together around a thousand computers that they called TPA. The last letter stands for 'analyser', the rest - I don't remember and I'm too lazy to google it now. Of course the "Hungarian Comrades" were not particularly conciencious, they stole and implemented the design of the best American mini-computer of the day - the PDP-8e, but... Oh, boy, the noise of these ventilators was awful. People in the big room where it stood could barely hear each other when I would fire up my 'machine'. :) I don't remember how many kilowatts it consumed, but the wires were really thick, I can tell you. And... it had _two_ (that's what the "i" stands for) 'cubes' (literally, cubes, I held them in my hand once) of memory 4k of 12 bit words each. Can you imagine? 4k words, where a full blown language FOCAL lived, where the programs for my CAMAC modules lived and even some data could live before I would dump it onto a paper punched through tape. All in 4k 12-bit words. For comparison, the graphical image of the cursor on your screen, probably, takes more memory. At that time the programmers were greedy. I remember there was a 'Checkmate' program that played chess (barely, but it didn't make obvious mistakes) and it would fit in those 4k words too.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And of course the 'socialist cooperation' brought 3 or 4 of these computers on the main physical institute, I would call it a 'flagman' of the Soviet Science... ha-ha-ha! Right then around that very same time Physics in that country fell into a coma and stayed in this persistent vegitative state until its death in the early nineties, but nobody told me then and it took me decades to find out what happened.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I got a computer then! I played with it. I read the DEC books about it, I read the Donald Knuth's books, I created my own programs... It was a fun. :)
