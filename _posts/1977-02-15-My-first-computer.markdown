I found a couple of pictures not so long ago and they reminded me of my first date with a real computer which happened on this day, February 15 of 1977... or maybe on another day, but around that time, the end of winter in 1977.<br><br>
### It was a long time ago and it is not true.
At that time I was studying Physics in the Moscow State University and was looking around for an opportunity to make a good project for my diploma, graduate with it (which is an equivalent of MS) and if I'm lucky find a job. Somebody... I know who that was but I stroke out his name from my memory and am not going to mension him here... brought me to the Plasma Physics Lab, because they needed a 'student who can solder' for an accelerator group that was working on something very important (ha-ha!). And that was me of course, because my then friend that I assemble my own 'effects' for the guitar performances that I was into then. In any case that was an interesting excursion into the world of _Real Physics_.<br>
At that time the Soviet Union was under all sorts of technological embargoes for its 'good' behavior in the Third World countries. It manufactured a complete copy of IBM 360 line somewhere in the Eastern European countries and a more compact (wardrobe sized) computer "Мир" which means "Peace" in Russian - the name that would tell you that it's as always something made for a purely military purpose. The Physics devision of the Moscow State University had a couple of those, they were breaking all the time and you had to get a time slot to run your program which students were not allowed to do unless they were doing it as a part of the course in programming (which was so idiotic that I didn't understand _anything_ from it, probably I was too stupid).
