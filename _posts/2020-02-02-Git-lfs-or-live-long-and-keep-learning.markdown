&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrangling with data and joggling with big CSV 
files is an everyday affair if you are doing something real. Sometimes 
I would _**die**_ for reverting what I've just done... to this 340Mb CSV 
file. Lately I started passing data between my applications and remote 
computers (like colab) in *.sqlite files, which are not much smaller but 
should be dealt with as (big) binary files. The version control is necessary!
Now, as it turns out there is this **git-lfs** 'extension' for git that 
had been designed a long time ago for just that. Duh!<br><br>
#### Where to find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will write more about it later, but for now 
here's a couple of links:<br><br>
- https://git-lfs.github.com/
- [about it on GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/lfs/manage_large_binaries_with_git_lfs.html)
- [about it on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage)<br>
