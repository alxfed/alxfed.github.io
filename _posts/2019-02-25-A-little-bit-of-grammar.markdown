&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed so obvious that humans will talk to machines as if they are humans, humans have this tendency of personification of pretty much everything, including the forces of nature, but it has a very subtle purely psychological difficulty and I have an idea how to overcome it, at least on our present stage of development.<br>
### Background
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's look into the book of linguistics and English Grammar in particular.
>In linguistics, grammatical mood (also mode) is a grammatical feature of verbs, used for signaling modality. <br>...examples of moods are indicative, interrogative, imperative, subjunctive, injunctive, optative, and potential.<br>...Some Uralic Samoyedic languages have more than ten moods; Nenets has as many as sixteen.<br><br>The original Indo-European inventory of moods consisted of indicative, subjunctive, optative, and imperative.<br>English has indicative, imperative, and subjunctive moods; other moods, such as the conditional, do not appear as morphologically distinct forms.<br>
