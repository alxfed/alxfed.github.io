&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's the Google definition of 'Animal language':
>Animal language are those forms of animal communication that are considered to show similarities to human language. Animal communication may be considered complex enough to be called a form of language if the inventory of signs is large, the signs are relatively arbitrary, and if the animals produce them with a degree of volition.

Very recognisable, isn't it? As if the unnamed author of this explanation is talking about the 'scientific' articles and 1467 page books of our day. I'm still working on the 'dictionary' of terms that I started putting together some time ago.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some results of my work, I will be adding more of them from time to time to this post.<br>

|Human Language |What the expression really means|  Animal-speak  |
|---|---|-------------------|
| |-- _**TensorFlow and TensorBoard**_ --| |
| **array** | A multidimentional array of numbers, matrix, it doesn't <br>mean that they have any specific properties with<br>regard to transformations of underlying space (as _real_ <br>tensors do). | **tensor** |
| **number of<br>indexes** | The number of indexes of the array; has nothing to do<br>with the number of linearly independent vectors in<br> a basis of the underlying space etc. | **rank** |
| | The list of natural numbers denoting the size of the<br>array in every dimension. | **shape** |

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just these three examples alone vividly demonstrate what I mean: the 'Animal-speak' uses the words well known in Human Language but _totally_ ignores the sophisticated meaning that has been assigned to these words a long time ago. For a simpleton with no education in _any_ science in its traditional meaning it seems to be "ok", but, believe me, this is _not_ OK. The even funnier example is the last word that doesn't have a human analog, because it describes a _**useless**_ anti-mathematical (but technically valid) parameter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common problem of all these 'renamings' and 'language pecularities' is that for the 'mechanical calculators' a table of numbers is just that - a table of numbers, not a representation of a space which may undergo transformations - translations, rotations etc. For their disciplines like PR or sociology there hardly is any 'trasformation'... maybe you can imagine replacing an advertisement on the tv with giving out a chocolate bar on every corner, that would be a 'rotation' of course. :) Anyways, you know what I mean, and I will be talking about this problem of jargon over and over again.<br>

I think I will continue this excercise somewhere else: [common-language](https://github.com/common-language)
<br><br>
Later.
