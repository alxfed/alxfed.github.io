title:  "'Programming without programming'... Oh! My..."
excerpt: "The wet Microsoft dream of 1990-s has come... true?... maybe not. All these 'self-services' like Zapier, IFTTT, etc.etc. Or what I've been doing for half a year."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit more than half a year ago I took a 
job and that's why I wasn't posting here. It's been a long journey, - I 
learned many new programming and data wrangling techniques, _almost_ 
started programming in node.js (not yet as of Today :) ) and in course
of executing tons of relatively small and _seemingly_ simple tasks in... 
like, probably, a __dosen__ of different services I started feeling that 
they all fit into a certain pattern of thought... or, maybe, a _dream_ 
that many people would collectively want to come true - the proverbial 
'Programming without programming'.<br><br>
#### How it all began... 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once upon a time, when pigs drank wine and 
monkeys chewed tobacco... the dreamer of the day envisioned the future 
full of 'automation' and the idle men and women lounging in the midst of 
it. Don't laugh, I saw the promo sci-fi enactment from the 50-s on CSPAN, 
filmed by a mega-corporation... it probably was GE. Of course these people 
will __not__ be doing any "coding" or something like that! They are 
lounging with their ladies and subsequent kids! At most they will be 
giving orders in this tone of voice specially designated for talking 
with help. And, by the way, there was no 'programming' 
per se at the time too. :) <br><br>
#### The Windows and Gates.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here comes Bill Gates and instead of opening 
the gates (of progress) starts crafting windows through which people 
will be just peeking (if they pay enough) instead of acting within the 
new environment full of data and ways to transform it. Of course you 
need to 'entertain' your captive crowd of peepers with something that is 
not really serious, but _seems_ to be really important for the 
'productivity'. Basically, it will not help your work in any real way, 
but you will _think_ that _some day_ it will and that's why you will 
__pay the price__ and agree with the 's...tware' End User 
License Agreement that states that it (the software that you are paying 
for) has "...NO...FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE" (the wording is for 
the current versions, in the past it was 'no particular use', basically, 
__useless__ :) , but expensive).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's how the wonderful idea of 'Programming 
without programming' came to life. <br><br>
#### Mama mia, here we go again...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some time it boiled down to some messy data 
wrangling within a CRM system and for the first time in maybe a couple 
of decades I had to deal again with the so called 'programming wihout programming'.
It is a euphimism for _you_ doing all the job of creating a system that you 
need out of bits and pieces put in an expensive toolbox for you by a 
craftsy (and enterpreneurial) bunch of 'programmers'. <br>The logic of this 
funny affair is very simple: "You - they say to you - need a system that 
would match your needs _exactly_, don't you? See! This means that you 
need an 'extra flexible' system, that can be turned into just about anything.
Your business is unique, we understand that. Now. Here's _your_ framework, 
the wheels are in that corner on the right, the engine is in that big room 
behind the small door, see? Yes, you can squeeze yourself through it, _we_ 
tried. Here's a 100 page manual how to loose enough weight so that you 
will be able to. Don't step on that rear fender! It will be not simple to 
make it assume its initial shape! By the way, did you get the invoice 
for the past five minutes of this converstation? No? We will email it to 
you within the next ten seconds." And all things like that...
<br><br>
And there comes a moment, typically after manually delining a couple of 
hundred records that you've just uploaded in 10 seconds because you clicked
the wrong microscopic button invented by a 'graphic designer' because 'he
thinks it looks cool'... by clicking each of these items _three times_ <br>
And you start thinking to yourself:"Maybe programming routine tasks was 
not such a hassle after all...?"<br>
And then you start writing programms using the API. Don't relax, you are 
just half the way there!<br><br>
Later
