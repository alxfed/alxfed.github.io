title:  "'Programming without programming'... Oh! My..."
excerpt: "The wet Microsoft dream of 1990-s has come... true?... maybe not. All these 'self-services' like Zapier... Or what I've been doing for half a year."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit more than half a year ago I took a 
job and that's why I wasn't posting here. It's been a long journey, - I 
learned many new programming and data wrangling techniques, _almost_ 
started programming in node.js (not yet as of Today :) ) and in course
of executing tons of relatively small and _seemingly_ simple tasks in... 
like, probably, a __dosen__ of different services I started feeling that 
they all fit into a certain pattern of thought... or, maybe, a _dream_ 
that many people would collectively want to come true - the proverbial 
'Programming without programming'.<br><br>
#### How it all began... 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once upon a time, when pigs drank wine and 
monkeys chewed tobacco... the dreamer of the day envisioned the future 
full of 'automation' and the idle men and women lounging in the midst of 
it. Don't laugh, I saw the promo sci-fi enactment from the 50-s, filmed 
by a mega-corporation... it probably was the GE. Of course these people 
will __not__ be doing any "coding" or something like that! They are 
lounging! At most they will be giving orders in this tone of voice specially 
designated for talking with help. And, by the way, there was no 'programming' 
per se at the time too. :) <br><br>
#### The Windows and Gates.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here comes Bill Gates and instead of opening 
the gates (of progress) starts crafting windows through which people will be just peeking 
(if they pay enough) instead of acting within the new environment full of 
data and ways to transform it. Of course you need to 'entertain' your 
captive crowd of peepers with something that is not really serious, but _seems_ to 
be really important for the 'productivity'. Basically, it will not help 
your work in any real way, but you will _think_ that some day it will 
and that's why you will __pay the price__ and agree with the 's...tware' End User 
License Agreement that states that it has "...NO...FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE" (the wording is for the current versions, in the 
past it was 'no particular use', basically, __useless__ :) , but expensive).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's how the wonderful idea of 'Programming without programming' 
came to life. <br><br>
After some time it boiled down to some messy data wrangling within a CRM system and for the first time in maybe a couple of decades I had to deal again with the so called 'programming wihout programming'.
<br><br>

Later.
