&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit more than half a year ago I took a 
job and that's why I wasn't posting here. It's been a long journey, - I 
learned many new programming and data wrangling techniques, _almost_ 
started programming in node.js (not yet as of Today :) ) and in course
of executing tons of relatively small and _seemingly_ simple tasks in... 
like, probably, a __dosen__ of different services I started feeling that 
they all fit into a certain pattern of thought... or, maybe, a _dream_ 
that many people would collectively want to come true - the 'Programming 
without programming'.<br>
After some time it boiled down to some messy data wrangling within a CRM system and for the first time in maybe a couple of decades I had to deal again with the so called 'programming wihout programming'.
<br><br>

Later.
