&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was watching all the time but I didn't notice when it happened... Now I know that the age of instant access to knowledge is here.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no doubt when Google started digitizing libraries that the day when __*all*__ the books and research papers will be downloadable from an online repository is near. Now this day has come, or has *almost* come.
