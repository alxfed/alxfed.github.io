&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been watching all the time but I didn't notice when it happened... Now I know that the age of instant access to knowledge is here.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no doubt when Google started digitizing whole libraries that the day when __*all*__ the books and research papers will be downloadable from an online repository is near. Now this day has come, or has *almost* come.<br><br>
## What has just happened?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of talking about techincalities - how all those 'evil people' 'steal copyrighted materials' and 'disseminate them' for free and who's business 'sustains tremendous injury and suffering' I will talk about the fact, namely: when I was growing in the Soviet Union in 1960-s I couldn't get the books that were _necessary_ for my intellectual development no matter how much I wanted, a 10 year old boy Today - __*can*__. Period, end of sentence. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__*Any*__ book is within instant reach today, - the books that are absolutely necessary for you, and you know it, the books that are not, the books that are __un__-necessary and counter your point of view in ridiculous ways; the books that are obsolete, the books that contain world views damaging for your intellect if you adopt them, but most of all - __*useless*__ and __*hollow*__ books, written for money alone, you sure know what I mean. They were written and published because the books were a type of merchandize in mass-demand and businessmen were 'satisfying the demand'... without thinking about the content of what they are selling, of course, as always.
