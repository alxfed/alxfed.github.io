&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been watching all the time but I didn't notice when it happened... Now I know that the age of instant access to knowledge is here.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no doubt when Google started digitizing whole libraries that the day when __*all*__ the books and research papers will be downloadable from an online repository is near. Now this day has come, or has *almost* come.<br><br>
## What has just happened?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of talking about techincalities - how all those 'evil people' 'steal copyrighted materials' and 'disseminate them' for free and who's business 'sustains tremendous injury and suffering' I will talk about the fact, namely: when I was growing in the Soviet Union in 1960-s I couldn't get the books that were _necessary_ for my intellectual development no matter how much I wanted, a 10 year old boy Today - __*can*__. Period, end of sentence. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__*Any*__ book is within instant reach today, - the books that are absolutely necessary for you, and you know it, the books that are not, the books that are __un__-necessary and counter your point of view in ridiculous ways; the books that are obsolete, the books that contain world views damaging for your intellect if you adopt them, but most of all - __*useless*__ and __*hollow*__ books, written for the money alone, you sure know what I mean. They were written and published because books were a type of merchandize in mass-demand and businessmen were 'satisfying the demand'... without thinking about the content of what they are selling, of course, as always. And there were always _crowds_ of liars for hire ready to _write a book_. That is the thing of the past.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the _two_ monopolies have fallen: the monopoly of the owners of printing presses and video pipes leading to your screen and the monopoly of libraries that sort, systematize and preserve the pile of knowledge of the humankind. Unlike the 'businessmen' from the 'publishing business' the librarians are probably totally happy, that their mission of preserving and disseminating knowledge and culture finally can be carried out to the physically possible extent. Our infrastructure is delivering required knowledge with the speed orders of magnitude higher than the speed at which it can be consumed by a human. Mission accomplished! The Librarians may be proud of themselves, we've reached this point because of them and it looks like only a few important parts of the paper culture of the past have been lost. <br>
