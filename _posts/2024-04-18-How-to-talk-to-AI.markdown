title:  "How to talk to Abstract Intellect?
 (A continuation of the old post)"
excerpt: "Even though the personification of 'AI' is in full swing, the real way to communicate with an Abstract Intellect is much more subtle and requires some in-depth understanding of Language and well-developed language skills...(which I'm striving to acquire)."

This is a continuation of the [old post](https://alxfed.github.io/blog/posts/2019/02/25/A-little-bit-of-grammar.html), from 2019 (which is still relevant, by the way).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seemed so obvious that humans will talk to machines as if they were humans; humans after all have this tendency of personification of pretty much everything, including the forces of nature..." - quote from 2019. And indeed, that's what is happening in 2024, - companies give names to their 'models' and start them with a capital letter as if they were persons; they teach these tables of numbers embedded into algorithms to respond in first person: "I am..." and pass judgements on human intentions of interlocutors without being asked to do so. Relax, that's a usual childhood disease, children are playing with their new toy. But jokes aside, how do we talk to an Abstract Intellect functionally present in these things? Without delving into the depth of the question "what exactly this type of conversation is?" how do we go about it? How do we put our words together so that the Abstract Intellect can respond to them? What language constructs or 'figures of speech' (more about them later) serve the purpose of these interactions best?<br><br>
### Before the conversation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out in 2023 and later that the 'self-service paradigm' goes as far as requiring us to configure our own 'AI' ourselves. This idea of infinitely configurable 'Artificial Intelligence' emerged as a part of the wet dream of some engineers to 'upload' a 'copy' of their 'intellect' (so many quotes, but they are all in place, including the last pair) and 'become immortal'. Never mind that really strange idea, now we are given a 'instructable' 'AI' that follows orders with devotion of an obedient slave, and we are put (by the engineers and their employers) into a position of involuntary 'master' of our personal **it** (a thing that had been taught to imitate a human). If you are psychologically uncomfortable in this role of an 'accidental slave-owner' you are not alone. But, deep thoughts about the problem aside, how do we configure the **thing** in the least offensive (for us) way, so that **it** helps us with our intellectual needs and deficiencies?

Later.
