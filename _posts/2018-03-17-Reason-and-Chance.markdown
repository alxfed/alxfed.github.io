&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we begin let me give you the meanings of these words that I'm using in this particular piece:<br><br>
__reason__ - 
1. a cause, explanation, or justification for an action or event.
2. the power of the mind to think, understand, and form judgments by a process of logic.<br>

__chance__ - 
1. the occurrence and development of events in the absence of any obvious design.
2. a possibility of something happening.<br><br>

I will mark the words with a superscript like this: chance<sup>2</sup>, reason<sup>1</sup>.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no doubt...<br><br>

Later.
