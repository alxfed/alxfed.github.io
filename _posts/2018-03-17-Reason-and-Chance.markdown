title:  "Reason, Hidden Variables and Chance."
excerpt: "There are many things in this world that happen for a Reason even if we don't know why but there are things that happen by Chance which means that they can not be (reasonably) explained."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we begin let me give you a short list of the meanings of the two most important words that I'm using in this particular piece:<br><br>
__reason__ - 
1. a cause, explanation, or justification for an action or event.
2. the power of the mind to think, understand, and form judgments by a process of logic.<br>

__chance__ - 
1. the occurrence and development of events in the absence of any obvious design.
2. a possibility of something happening.<br>

__variable__ - 
1. an element, feature, or factor that is liable to vary or change.
2. (mathematics) a quantity which during a calculation is assumed to vary or
be capable of varying in value.
3. experimental variable - (statistics) a variable whose values are
independent of changes in the values of other variables.<br>

__experiment__ -
1. A test under controlled conditions that is made to demonstrate a known truth, to examine the validity of a hypothesis, or to determine the efficacy of something previously untried.<br>

I will mark the words with a superscript like this: chance<sup>2</sup>, reason<sup>1</sup> when there can be a confusion as to what meaning of the word I'm using in a sentence.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no lack of interest in studying the relationship between explainable/causal and random aspects of reality surrounding us. Pretty much every philosopher of the past worth his salt had an opinion on this subject. Maybe that is why the relatively simple meaning of this duality is still so blurred and uncertain for many.<br><br>

Later.
