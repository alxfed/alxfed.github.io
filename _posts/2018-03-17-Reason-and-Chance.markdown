title:  "Reason, Hidden Variables and Chance."
excerpt: "There are many things in this world that happen for a Reason even if we don't know why but there are things that happen by Chance which means that they can not be (reasonably) explained."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we begin let me give you a short list of the meanings of the two most important words that I'm using in this particular piece:<br><br>
__reason__ - 
1. a cause, explanation, or justification for an action or event.
2. the power of the mind to think, understand, and form judgments by a process of logic.<br>

__chance__ - 
1. the occurrence and development of events in the absence of any obvious design.
2. a possibility of something happening.<br>

__variable__ - 
1. an element, feature, or factor that is liable to vary or change.
2. (mathematics) a quantity which during a calculation is assumed to vary or
be capable of varying in value.
3. experimental variable - (statistics) a variable whose values are
independent of changes in the values of other variables.<br>

__experiment__ -
1. A test under controlled conditions that is made to demonstrate a known truth, to examine the validity of a hypothesis, or to determine the efficacy of something previously untried.<br>

I will mark the words with a superscript like this: chance<sup>2</sup>, reason<sup>1</sup> when there can be a confusion as to what meaning of the word I'm using in a sentence.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no lack of interest in studying the relationship between explainable/causal and random aspects of reality surrounding us. Pretty much every philosopher of the past worth his salt had an opinion on this subject. Maybe that is why the relatively simple meaning of this duality is still so blurred and uncertain for many. I would like to summarize what I've learned in the past several years for myself in order to have a ready 'cheat sheet' for everyday use.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost let me remind you that the Cult of Correlation (Galton, Pearson, Fisher) didn't acknowledge the existence of cause and effect relationships in their data or, better to say, they assumed that the relationships within their data are _infinitely_ complex and the observable parameters in their non-experiments (later about it) are _infinitely_ complex aglomerations of parameters too. In this case of an infinite dimensionality one can argue that the cause and effect relationship is always 'averaged' over the set of contributing factors. The second part of their doctrine was a concept of 'observation' or 'sample' which is not an experiment where the observer makes an attempt of figuring out the causal dependence of the phenomenon under investigation by deliberatly changing the conditions of it and observing the result of such changes. The Cult of Correlation under a false pretence that they are dealing with situations where intervention is 'impossible' rejected these time sequences of events (during the experiment) as a valuable source of information about the __behavior__ of the system under investigation. In this sense what they are talking about is always an imprint of a pre-historic animal in a rock - the timeless snapshot of the results of multiple infinitely complex sequences of events. Again, for the biological systems that were their primary concern this assumption can be deemed close enough to reality.<br>
