&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know about the problem of distance in mathematics, don't you? In a strange way it's probably the most metaphysical question of science, or at least it seems to be extremely metaphysical to me and here is why.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mental construct of distance is based on our vision and our sense of continuous time. Our brain or, better to say, the way it 'perceives' space-time is playing a trick on us by performing an inverse transform in the imaginary space of possibilities. I mean that what _really_ exist is the possibility for a physical object located roughly near the point A to move to a proverbial point B. It is especially 'obvious' when there is 'nothing' in between and we call this visible absence of material obstacles, separating A and B - 'space'. Watch once again what your brain just did: it presumed that if there is 'nothing' between A and B then the object that is in A now _can_ _move_ to B. This in its turn is based on presumption that the 'dimension' of time exists and is changing continuously.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another assumption that has snuck into our observation is the cause-effect relationship between the present state of an object 'in point A' as a cause of what _can be_ the 'same' object but 'in point B'. This is _the_ main reason why the brain performs a backward calculation from that
visibly possible state to the present state of the object and says that the difference between these two is 'space' or even 'distance' - a more quantitative feeling that the brain invokes.<br>

> Note aside: This is one of the mental traps of graphic depictions of all sorts and kinds. It seems to be 'obvious' that by means of some kind of 'nudging' one point can be 'moved' (continuously) from its present position to another one. Not in the slightest! In most real-life cases there is no way to 'nudge' a data point, in this sense _all_ the points between A and B don't even exist, but they are present on your graph, n.

As to the fact that once it has been moved from A to B the object _is not necessarily the same_ every student of Thermodynamics who saw the P/V diagrams of the 'Carno Cycle' or other similar ones knows that _**the other**_ (hidden, not depicted on the diagram) variables may change dramatically if you change the path or even the direction (hi 'hysteresis loop') of movement along the path between these symbolic 'points' A and B.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time we are clearly missing something here, namely the opportunity to create an 'obvious' representation usable in our most abstract reasoning, for instance a way to quantify the dissimilarity of meanings or optimality of models... The traditional deliberation about the 'replaceability' of different changes in dimensions is too narrow and most importantly is lacking the apparent dependence on the 'previous history' of the phenomenon under observation.<br>

### The Universal Method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a 'Universal' method that would be so intuitive that it would apply in any and every case? Of course there is! We've just discussed it, it is called "getting from here to there"! The difference in position or, even broader, **state** can be described constructively as a path from point A to point B built of a sequence of steps. The steps can be large or small or even infinitesimally small or infinitely large, but they are a continuous sequence.<br>

### The Universal Dimension
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from what we've said in the beginning and our human 'intuition' we immediately know how to 'parametrize' this sequence: by the time spent on going down the path! Notice that we can include anything and everything in the definition of 'time spent', all the information gathering and (hard) deciion making can be included. That is very useful for our synthesis, 'intuitive' probably even 'obvious'. And it's an (additive) scalar too, we know how to deal with scalars, because their composition is just the arithmetical sum that we know how to calculate. 
>Well, there are some subtleties here too, because when the object goes down the second part of the composite path it is happening _after the first part_ which might have changed the hidden variables, intrinsic to the object.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice that our 'invention' covers pretty much everything else: the 'distance' measured along the straight line, the 'Euclidian distance' defined by the Pythagoras theorem, all sorts of 'information distances' (because we have a decision algorithm 'metrics' as a factor in the time duration). Looks nice. I like it.<br>

### What variables are hidden then?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By refusing to assign a value to the paths that haven't happened we declare pretty much everything to be a hidden variable. For instance in the simplest case of a mechanical system not only the speed, acceleration and mass are hidden variables for a particular position of the object, the mutual distances between objects are hidden too. In a sense what we are thinking about here is a reincarnation of the signaling with light in the traditional metaphor of the special relativity theory. We are not using any 'light' though, we are using the natural transformations of the system itself that _are_ possible and nothing else.
