use this length instead of 'distance'."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know about the problem of distance in mathematics,
don't you? In a strange way it's probably the most metaphysical question of
science, or at least it seems to be extremely metaphysical to me and here is
why.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mental construct of distance is based on our vision and our implied sense of continuous time. Our brain or, better to say, the way it 'perceives' space-time is playing a trick on us by performing an inverse transform in the imaginary space of possibilites. I mean that what _really_ exist is the possibility for a physical object located roughly near the point A to move to the proverbial point B. It is especially 'obvious' when there is 'nothing' in between and we call this absense of obstacles, separating A and B - 'space'.
Watch once again what your brain just did: it presumed that if there is 'nothing' between A and B then the object that is in in A now _can_ _move_ to B. This in its turn is based on presumption that the dimension of time exists and is changing continuously.
