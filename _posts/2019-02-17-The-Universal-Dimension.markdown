depend on it."

use this length instead of the fictitious dimension called 'distance'."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know about the problem of distance in mathematics, don't you? In a strange way it's probably the most metaphysical question of science, or at least it seems to be extremely metaphysical to me and here is why.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mental construct of distance is based on our vision and our sense of continuous time. Our brain or, better to say, the way it 'perceives' space-time is playing a trick on us by performing an inverse transform in the imaginary space of possibilities. I mean that what _really_ exist is the possibility for a physical object located roughly near the point A to move to a proverbial point B. It is especially 'obvious' when there is 'nothing' in between and we call this visible absence of material obstacles, separating A and B - 'space'. Watch once again what your brain just did: it presumed that if there is 'nothing' between A and B then the object that is in A now _can_ _move_ to B. This in its turn is based on presumption that the 'dimension' of time exists and is changing continuously.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another assumption that has snuck into our observation is the cause-effect relationship between the present state of an object 'in point A' as a cause of what _can be_ the 'same' object but 'in point B'. This is _the_ main reason why the brain performs a backward calculation from that
visibly possible state to the present state of the object and says that the difference between these two is 'space' or even 'distance' - a more quantitative feeling that the brain invokes.<br>

> Note aside: This is one of the mental traps of graphic depictions of all sorts and kinds. It seems to be 'obvious' that by means of some kind of 'nudging' one point can be 'moved' (continuously) from its present position to another one. Not in the slightest! In most real-life cases there is no way to 'nudge' a data point, in this sense _all_ the points between A and B don't even exist, but they are present on your graph, n.

As to the fact that once it has been moved from A to B the object _is not necessarily the same_ every student of Thermodynamics who saw the P/V diagrams of the 'Carno Cycle' or other similar ones knows that _**the other**_ (hidden, not depicted on the diagram) variables may change dramatically if you change the path or even the direction (hi 'hysteresis loop') of movement along the path between these symbolic 'points' A and B.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time we are clearly missing something here, namely the opportunity to create an 'obvious' representation usable in our most abstract reasoning, for instance a way to quantify the dissimilarity of meanings or optimality of models... The traditional deliberation about the 'replaceability' of different changes in dimensions is too narrow and most importantly is lacking the apparent dependence on the 'previous history' of the phenomenon under observation.
