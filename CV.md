2017 - present

__*Data scientist, independent contractor.*__

I take small to medium data science projects (less than a year) in Chicago, IL or tele.<br>
Green Card holder, work authorization in the US.

__A typical project:__
- Definition of the problem and tools; definition of what should be delivered;
- Data cleaning and organizing in a usable 'library' (I don't use marketing terms like 'lakes' etc.etc.);
- Modelling and the 'Design of Experiment' or choice of a Machine Learning tool(s);
- Work itself;
- Presentation of results and deliverables; reprocessing and reformatting of results if necessary.

__Tools:__ I feel most comfortable using Python/RStudio/R and SQLite (with an external 1T HD on USB 3.0) or Apache Spark (on databricks.com), and remote databases for my everyday work but I can dive into the depth of LLVM and C too if it is (absolutely) necessary. Also, there is nothing in the world a Ph.D. in Physics and Mathematics who started writing code in assembler on PDP-8 in 1978 and has been working with all sorts and kinds of experimental data (from medical and physics experiments to business and market/financial data) ever since can not learn in a month. I can prove it if necessary.<br>

__Interests:__ I'm interested in Topological Data Analysis (TDA), Multivariate Scaling and Principle Component Analysis. I read and write texts and code about it in my spare time. The 'inverse problem' of (re)constructing decision forests from a trained NN is very interesting too, but it is still a bit of a desire rather than a real work that can be done in a straighforward way.
